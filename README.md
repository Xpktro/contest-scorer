### Using as a Library

```typescript
import { scoreContest } from 'contest-scorer'
import type { Participant, ContestRules } from 'contest-scorer'

// Define your contest rules
const rules: ContestRules = {
  name: 'My Contest',
  start: '2025-04-01T00:00:00Z',
  end: '2025-04-02T23:59:59Z',
  rules: {
    validation: [
      'timeRange',
      ['bands', { '40m': ['7000', '7300'] }],
      ['mode', ['SSB', 'CW']],
    ],
    scoring: [['default', 1]],
    bonus: [['default', 1]],
    tiebreaker: ['validStations'],
  },
}

// Define your submissions (callsign and ADIF data)
const submissions: Participant[] = [
  ['OA4T', adifData1],
  ['OA4P', adifData2],
]

// Score the contest
const results = scoreContest(submissions, rules)

// Access results
console.log('Final standings:', results.results)
console.log('Detailed scoring:', results.scoringDetails)
console.log('Missing participants:', results.missingParticipants)
console.log(results)
```

## Rules Configuration

Contest rules are defined in a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "contest_name",
  "start": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end": "2025-01-01T00:59:59Z",
  "blacklist": ["callsign1", "callsign2"],
  "allowMissingParticipants": true,
  "rules": {
    "validation": [
      "rule1",
      ["rule2", { "param1": "value1", "param2": "value2" }]
    ],
    "scoring": ["default"],
    "bonus": [["rule1", { "param1": "value1" }]],
    "tiebreaker": ["rule1", "rule2"]
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules

- `default`: Validates if there's a matching contact record in the contacted callsign's log. Takes optional parameters:
  - `maximumTimeDiff`: Maximum time difference in minutes (default: 2)
  - `maximumFrequencyDiff`: Maximum frequency difference in kHz (default: 2)
- `timeRange`: Validates if the contact is within the contest time range.
- `bands`: Validates if the contact is on a valid band. Format: `{"band1": ["start", "end"], "band2": ["start", "end"]}`
- `mode`: Validates if the contact is using a valid mode. Format: `["mode1", "mode2"]`
- `contactedInContest`: Validates if the contacted callsign is a participant in the contest.
- `uniqueContactsByTimeRange`: Validates one contacted callsign per time range. Format: `{"firstHalf": ["start", "end"], "secondHalf": ["start", "end"]}`
- `exchange`: Validates if the contact has a valid exchange using a regex.
- `minimumContacts`: **Validation-level rule** that removes participants who don't appear in enough logs across the contest. A participant must be contacted by at least this many different stations to be eligible for scoring. Each participant log counts as one appearance regardless of how many times they appear in that log. This rule also enables "missing participants" - stations that don't submit logs but can still award points if they appear in enough logs. Format: `5`

#### Top-level Validation Rules

- `blacklist`: Excludes specific callsigns from receiving or awarding points and from appearing in the final rankings. Format: `["callsign1", "callsign2"]`
- `allowMissingParticipants`: Controls whether contacts with stations that did not submit a log should be validated and their contacts scored. When true, contacts with missing participants are accepted and scored. When false or not defined, contacts with missing participants are rejected. Format: `true/false`

### Scoring Rules

- `default`: Assigns a default score to each contact. Default is 1.
- `timeRange`: Assigns different scores based on time ranges. Format: `{"firstHalf": 2, "secondHalf": 3}`
- `bonusStations`: Assigns bonus scores for contacting certain stations. Format: `{"OA4O": 5, "OA4EFJ": 3}`
- `minimumContacts`: **Contact-level rule** that prevents contacts from awarding points if the contacted station doesn't appear in enough logs. A contacted station must appear in at least this many different submitted logs to award points to others. Each participant log counts as one appearance regardless of how many times the station appears in that log. Format: `2`

### Bonus Rules

- `default`: Multiplies the total score by a value. Default is 1.

### Tiebreaker Rules

- `default`: Sorts contestants by score.
- `validStations`: Breaks ties by the number of valid stations contacted (more is better).
- `minimumTime`: Breaks ties by the time span between first and last contact (less is better).

### Caveat: minimumContacts rules

The contest scorer supports two separate `minimumContacts` rules that work at different levels:

1. **Validation minimumContacts**: Applied during validation to remove entire participants who don't appear in enough logs
2. **Scoring minimumContacts**: Applied during scoring to prevent individual contacts from awarding points if the contacted station doesn't appear in enough logs

#### Appearance Counting Logic

Both rules use the same appearance counting logic:

- A station gets **one appearance** per submitted log, regardless of how many times it appears in that log
- For example, if OA4T contacts OA4P five times in their log, OA4P still only gets 1 appearance from OA4T's log
- Appearances are counted across all submitted logs to determine total appearances

### Output Format

The scoring engine returns a structured `ContestResult` object with detailed information:

```typescript
interface ContestResult {
  // Array of [callsign, score] tuples sorted by score
  results: [string, number][]

  // Detailed scoring information for each participant
  scoringDetails: {
    [callsign: string]: {
      bonusRuleApplied: string | null // Name of the bonus rule applied
      givenBonus: number // Bonus points given
      hasMinimumAppearances: boolean // Whether station met minimum appearances
      contacts: {
        // Original ADIF fields plus:
        invalidValidationRule: string | null // Name of violated rule or null if valid
        scoreRule: string | null // Name of the rule used to calculate score
        givenScore: number // Score given for this contact
      }[]
    }
  }

  // Array of [callsign, appearanceCount] tuples for stations that didn't submit logs but appeared in other logs
  missingParticipants: [string, number][]

  // Array of [callsign, appearanceCount] tuples for blacklisted callsigns that were found in contacts
  blacklistedCallsignsFound: [string, number][]
}
```

The `missingParticipants` array will contain all stations that were contacted but didn't submit logs, as long as `allowMissingParticipants` is set to `true`. Each entry is a tuple containing the callsign and the number of logs in which that station appeared. These stations won't appear in the `results` array but they can award points if they meet the minimum appearance threshold defined by any `minimumContacts` rules.

The `blacklistedCallsignsFound` array contains tuples of blacklisted callsigns that were found in submitted logs along with their appearance counts.

Both arrays are sorted alphabetically by callsign.

The CSV output contains only the callsign and total score, while the JSON output contains the full detailed result object.

## Important Notes and Caveats

### Missing Participants Behavior

- Missing participants (stations that were contacted but didn't submit logs) are always tracked in the output, regardless of whether `allowMissingParticipants` is true or false.
- When `allowMissingParticipants` is false, contacts with missing participants are still tracked but don't award points.
- With the dual `minimumContacts` architecture:
  - **Validation minimumContacts**: Missing participants must appear in at least this many logs to be eligible for validation
  - **Scoring minimumContacts**: Missing participants must appear in at least this many logs to award points to others

### Appearance Counting vs Contact Counting

The new architecture distinguishes between:

- **Appearances**: How many different logs a station appears in (used by `minimumContacts` rules)
- **Contacts**: How many individual QSOs a station has in their own log (used by legacy behavior)

### Score Calculation

- The scoring process applies all scoring rules in sequence, with each rule potentially overriding the previous score.
- The final score is calculated as: sum of all valid contact scores Ã— bonus multiplier.
- The `scoreRule` field in the detailed output shows which rule was responsible for the final score of each contact.

### Handling Edge Cases

- Duplicate contacts (same callsign, band, and mode within a time range) are automatically rejected.
- Time differences between logs are handled with the `maximumTimeDiff` parameter (default: 2 minutes).
- Frequency differences are handled with the `maximumFrequencyDiff` parameter (default: 2 kHz).
- For cross-mode contacts (e.g., SSB/CW), both modes must be in the allowed modes list.

### Data Requirements

- For best results, ensure all ADIF files include accurate timestamps, frequencies, and modes.
- RST and exchange fields are validated if present but are not required by default.
- Missing or incomplete logs will affect overall contest scoring accuracy.

## ADIF Files

The tool expects ADIF files named with the participant's callsign (e.g., `OA4T.adi`). If the callsign cannot be determined from the filename, the contest cannot be properly scored.
